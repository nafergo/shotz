# Shotz

Shotz is a simple php web-based shot/task list management for short movie productions. You can add/edit/delete shots and tasks to a simple flat file database. There are no current plans to develop this any further, development goes in a strict as-needed policy.

You can easily create a shot, choose/edit the current task of the shot (for example, modeling or compositing), choose/edit the assigned user and choose/edit the status (for example, on going or rendering). You can close shots when they are finished or delete them. Shotz display the number and % of shots done and frames rendered.
