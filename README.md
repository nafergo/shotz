# Shotz

Shotz is a simple php web-based shot/task list management for short movie productions. You can add/edit/delete shots to a simple flat file database (JSON text file). Each shot has an artist assigned, current task, status and due date. There are no current plans to develop this any further, development goes in a strict as-needed policy.

You can easily create a shot, choose/edit the current task of the shot (for example, modeling or compositing), choose/edit the assigned user and choose/edit the status (for example, on going or rendering). You can close shots when they are finished or delete them. Shotz displays the number and % of shots done and frames rendered.

Shotz was developed by nelson gon√ßalves (nafergo) with the precious help of Ivan Terra.
